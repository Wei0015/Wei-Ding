My personal repository
Hi! Iâ€™m Wei Ding, Data Science and Psychology student with a strong foundation in machine learning, data analysis, and research. Proven experience with neuroimaging, cognitive data analysis, and database design, eager to apply analytical and programming skills to real-world challenges in healthcare and technology. My professional portfolio includes hands-on projects such as svm-sentiment-analysis-customer-feedback, a travel-planning app with an intuitive interface, and my capstone Fall AI Studio project, which is featured at the top of my GitHub. Each repository includes comprehensive details such as Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, and guides for replication.

I would like to contributing the data science community and engaging in open-source projects. Feel free to connect me on LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-ding-b9290b226. For collaboration opportunities, please reach out: dingwei0015@gmail.com .
